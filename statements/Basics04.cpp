int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    int &i = func(5);
    // Here we happen to have still a value in i. 
    std::cout << i << " " << g(3) << std::endl;
    // And even if I call here func again, it will still have the value.
    func(10);
    std::cout << i << std::endl;

    // If we add a call of func() inside another function, the address of i, stops meaning anything.
    callFunc();
    std::cout << i << std::endl; //this prints 0. The memory stored in i has been wiped from the stack.
