/*  C++ Algorithms 3
    
    Given the struct Vertex, representing vertices in a graph, write a function DFVisit() that traverses the graph and fills 
    the vector result with all connected vertices in Depth First order. Write a comment with the time complexity of your implementation.

//about the complexity: 
//  This recursive approach will iterate for each adjacent vertex of every adjacent vertex.
//      Increasing at a rate of the square of vertexes. O(N^2).
//  Also, we have to take in account the speed of the std::find function which is linear time.
//      Considering aswell that we are using find in a vector, which is faster than any other container.
//      Considering also that we are using pointers, that would make it slower.
