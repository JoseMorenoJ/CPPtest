/*  C++ Advanced 3
    
    You are debugging a program using your usual debugger and it always crashes on the same memory address because it has been corrupted. 
    The problem is that you don't know when it could happen and you don't know what line of source code is causing the crash 
    (And you can't check all the code... That would take too much time). 
    
    Write a comment explaining the steps you will take in order to find the cause of the problem.

    --> I have not much experience debugging a problem like this, I cannot be precise about what would I do.
    --> I would set a breakpoint in the address I know it is corrupted to see when the program is trying to
    -->    access it. Maybe in the adress just before it, if it stops before the break.
