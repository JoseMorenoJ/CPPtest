/*  C++ Advanced 2
    
    Extend class A in such a way that dynamically allocated instances will be placed inside the memory occupied by g_classPool.
    Assume instances will be freed in order opposite of the order of creation.

    Write a comment documenting what needs to be added if we want to allocate arrays as well as individual objects.
    --> To allocate arrays we should as well overload the A::operator new[]()  and A::operator delete[]()

    Write a comment explaining what needs to be added to the program so that all dynamic allocation uses memory from g_classPool.
    --> To modify the allocation for all the dynammic allocation we have to overload all this operators but
    -->   outside the class A.
