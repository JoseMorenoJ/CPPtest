/*  C++ Basics 13
    
    You are working on a Space Simulator game. For some reason, ships in your game are sometimes failing to die (but sometimes they work). 
    Debugging has shown that the Ship::GetHit method is properly called with the proper damage. 

    Fix the problems in the class below.
