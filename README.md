# What is CPPtest?
A C++ knowledge test given to me from a company during the selection procces for a C++ developer position.

When I received it I didn't have much experience with C++ or as a developer, moreover, they rejected me. I was supposed to finish the test in 6 hours. Well, I had 6 hours to do as much as I could but, still today, I am not sure if they were expecting me (or the selected candidate) to finish all the exercises.

## What to find in this repo?
When I did the test, I failed big time. But I also learnt about what was expected from me as a candidate. In this repo I will repeat the test, exercise by exercise, explaining the solutions the best I can. Maybe even showing alternative solutions.
- The solutions for the problems
- The explanation for each soution
- Additional links to external info

## How can you contribute?
Actually, as I still consider myself new in development, I would like to encourage you to give your opinion about the solutions. Give me alternative solutions, faster or just more elegant. Also, english is not my native language so feel free to correct straight away any typo.
- Give me your opinion, correct my solution if it is wrong
- Give an alternative to my solution (faster, more elegant...)
- Correct any typo 

# Organization
We will use tags to set the different milestones in the proyect.

### Branches
I have the intention to use one branch for each kind of problem (Basic, Algorithms, Maths and Advanced) to be able to isolate the different sets of porblems.
    - basics
    - maths
    - algo
    - advanced

All the branches will merge with master once they are solved. 

### Releases
#### v.0 : Statements
This extract the code from "Statements" version and you will get only that, the statements. Not a single problem solved.

# In Progress
Right now, we are structuring the README so it will be easy to navigate through the different problems and solutions.
Considering to keep a copy of the Statements as part of the code to be able to compare when presenting the solution.
We have to add links to the README.md file so you can follow the different kinds of problems.
